gnome-shell-shutdowntimer
=========================

GNOME shell 3.6 extension for fast and easy setup of scheduled shutdown.

Heavily based on Lukas Knuth's Backslide code at https://bitbucket.org/LukasKnuth/backslide

Known issues
------------

The shutdown does not complete until confirmed in a dialog invoked if there is an application like Rhytmbox running (and playing).
