gnome-shell-shutdowntimer
=========================

GNOME Shell extension placing an icon in status area with a simple slider for fast and easy setup of scheduled shutdown.

Heavily based on Lukas Knuth's Backslide code at https://bitbucket.org/LukasKnuth/backslide

Installation
------------

Unzip the archive so that the `shutdowntimer@lusk.cz` folder is in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions

Known issues
------------

There are no notifications sent reminding that the timer is running.
If the *Even with unsaved documents* toggle is enabled there is not even a shutdown dialog. But who cares, right? :)
